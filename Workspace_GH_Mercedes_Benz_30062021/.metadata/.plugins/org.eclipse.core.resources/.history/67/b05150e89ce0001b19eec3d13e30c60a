	/*There are two kinds of Assertions / Validation in TestNG framework:
	 * 
	 * 1) Soft Assertion - >. SoftAssert class
	 * 2) Hard Assertion --> Assert class 
	 * 
	 * Working Behaviour:
	 * If assertions fails at a particular line, from that line onwards, the compilation stops.This 
	 * is the story of HARD ASSERTION. The test annotation method in which ASSERTION failed, will fail, the
	 * test case will fail and the suite will fail.We can use the ASSERTION class or ASSERT class
	 * 
	 * If assertions fails at a particular line, the lines below the line where assertions failed,
	 * is compiled. This is the story of SOFT ASSERTION but remember to use the ASSERT ALL method.
	 * The test annotation method in which ASSERTION failed, will fail, the
	 * test case will fail and the suite will fail.

	/*IF LoginRediffmail() fails because of Assertion error, how can SendMail()() pass. Strictly we cannot
	Send mail if login fails.
	
	1) The Logout() test annotation method is failing due to assertion error. BUt LOGOUT is inside the 
	inbox page of Rediffmail  and if login is failure, how can we send mail pass and how can 
	logout happen. 
	
	Thats means Logout() test annotation method and Sendmail() test annotation method depends on 
	LoginRediffmail() Test annotation method.We need to create this dependency.
	
	* IF LoginRediffmail() Test annotation method fails, Logout() test annotation method and Sendmail() 
	* test annotation method should SKIP.
